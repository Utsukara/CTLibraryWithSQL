# Coding Temple Library with Structured Query Language

1. **database.py**:
   - Manages database connections and operations such as adding, removing, and updating entries in tables like books, authors, genres, and users.
   - Contains methods to perform specific actions like borrowing and returning books, including date handling for due dates.
   - Functions to authenticate users and manage user sessions are also included.

2. **main.py**:
   - Serves as the entry point of the program.
   - Initializes database connections and starts the user interface loop by calling the initial menu handler from `user_interface.py`.

3. **models.py**:
   - Defines data models for objects used in the application, such as `Book`, `User`, `Author`, `Genre`, and `BorrowedBook`.
   - Each model has properties and methods relevant to its real-world representation and interactions, such as updating availability or user contact info.

4. **utilities.py** (if used as described):
   - This would typically contain utility functions or classes that assist in database operations, validations, or any other helper functions that don't fit directly into the other modules.
   - Can be used to organize code that is common across multiple modules to avoid duplication and improve maintenance.

5. **user_interface.py**:
   - Manages all user interactions through command-line interfaces, handling inputs and displaying outputs.
   - Controls the flow of the application based on user choices, directing to different functionalities like managing books, users, authors, and genres.
   - Implements loops for handling operations until the user decides to exit.

This structure allows separation of concerns where each file handles specific aspects of the application, making it easier to manage and extend.
